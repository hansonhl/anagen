On the other hand to be able to outline and do the thing that were talked about today to basically completely <anteced> revamp </anteced> the public health system so that local officials can talk to state officials that can talk to federal officials to be able to pinpoint exactly when a cluster of bird flu happens,that,it,it,it,this,this

"So Michelle the authorities really believe that uh this witness with regard to the landfill 's credible , do n't they ? Well the authorities including the FBI <anteced> we </anteced> found out had checked this witness out early on just days after Natalee disappeared . And",we,we,we,we,we,we
Well it turns out he was just afraid for his identity to be known . but we learned that he came forward very quickly after he says he saw what happened in the landfill that day just days after it happened . He talked to police . He talked to the FBI . The FBI actually went out to that landfill with dogs looked around <anteced> that area </anteced> even before,it,it,it,it,it,that area
but we learned that he came forward very quickly after he says he saw what happened in the landfill that day just days after it happened . He talked to police . He talked to the FBI .

It 's <anteced> the EquuSearch volunteers </anteced> who really said hey,we,you,we,we,we,we
It 's the EquuSearch volunteers who really said hey we believe this guy . His story does n't change . He seems to pan out . He seems to be a lucid guy .

But when the wind blew he says he saw the upper part of a woman 's body blonde hair . and then he says they buried this body there in the landfill . Well over a period of weeks some ten feet of garbage has piled up . EquuSearch will tell you too that when they bring out dogs it 's very difficult for <anteced> a dog </anteced> to catch a scent in that landfill when,they,it,it,it,it,it
but they 're determined to keep going . He saw uh the woman 's body and inside a bag . Her hair was blowing out with the wind .

but they want to clear that place out and just feel satisfied that they looked as best they could because it 's disturbing . I mean his story has panned out in some ways . so they do n't want to give this up . Well that 's the question I have for you Michelle . So are you saying that <anteced> the authorities </anteced> uh looked into this guy 's story early on and,they,they,they,they,they,they

We were awakened uh about four in the morning uh by <anteced> loud yelling coming from the cabin </anteced> . Um,it,it,this cabin,that cabin,the cabin,it
We were awakened uh about four in the morning uh by loud yelling coming from the cabin . Um it sounded like people uh cheering uh like a drinking contest type thing . And <anteced> he </anteced> says uh later um chief that,he,he,he,he,he,he
We were awakened uh about four in the morning uh by loud yelling coming from the cabin . Um it sounded like people uh cheering uh like a drinking contest type thing . And he says uh later um chief that he heard <anteced> a horrific thud </anteced> . Well yeah,that,it,it,that,that thud,the thud
And the question that has to be uh presented to everybody is why is it taking so long for authorities to interview <anteced> the individual that was in a cabin next door </anteced> ? Mhm . Any seasoned investigator would know that you would want to conduct your interviews uh of possible witnesses immediately after the crime . Yeah . Yeah . And you would not just interview,that individual next door,the suspect,that person,that individual,that person,that particular individual
And you would not just interview that individual next door . You would have to take a step to interview people above below and to both sides . Susan what 's the answer to that ? But Dan . there are jurisdictional problems here . You know it 's not a clear cut case as to who gets to prosecute this case . Turkey ca n't do anything without a body . <anteced> United States </anteced> can . Fair play of,the United States,we,us,that,us,United States
Turkey ca n't do anything without a body . United States can . Fair play of the United States for stepping in . fair play to law enforcement for getting involved . Jurisdiction is n't clear . but they 're working very hard to solve the crime . I do n't think the criticism is well placed against law enforcement in this case . Also <anteced> the crime scene </anteced> oh if you want to call,it,the crime scene,it,that <anaphor>crime scene,that,the crime scene
United States can . Fair play of the United States for stepping in . fair play to law enforcement for getting involved . Jurisdiction is n't clear . but they 're working very hard to solve the crime . I do n't think the criticism is well placed against law enforcement in this case . Also the crime scene oh if you want to call it that was cleaned up by the cruise ship who got <anteced> their </anteced> investigators and,their,they,their,they,their,they
I do n't think the criticism is well placed against law enforcement in this case . Also the crime scene oh if you want to call it that was cleaned up by the cruise ship who got their investigators and their lawyers in from what I understand right away to make this go away . so I think <anteced> law enforcement </anteced> was put in a bad position trying to play catchup . and I think,they,they,they,they,that,their
<anteced> Larry </anteced> so uh any chance now based on the fact that things have been cleaned up et cetera to get any usable evidence ? Well it 's very difficult Dan . Uh obviously as we keep saying we do not have a body . therefore we do not have a cause or a manner of the death . But we do have some physical evidence . Unfortunately examination of the photograph uh tells,me,Larry,Larry,Larry,Larry,Larry
Larry so uh any chance now based on the fact that things have been cleaned up et cetera to get any usable evidence ? Well it 's very difficult Dan . Uh obviously as we keep saying we do not have a body . therefore we do not have a cause or a manner of the death . But we do have some physical evidence .

Uh obviously as we keep saying we do not have a body . therefore we do not have a cause or a manner of the death . But we do have some physical evidence . Unfortunately examination of <anteced> the photograph </anteced> uh tells me it was not done the proper way .,It,It,That,The photograph,It,It
Uh obviously as we keep saying we do not have a body . therefore we do not have a cause or a manner of the death . But we do have some physical evidence . Unfortunately examination of the photograph uh tells me <anteced> it </anteced> was not done the proper way .,It,It,It,It,That,It
Uh obviously as we keep saying we do not have a body . therefore we do not have a cause or a manner of the death . But we do have some physical evidence . Unfortunately examination of the photograph uh tells me it was not done the proper way . It was n't a forensic photograph . So I really do not know how large <anteced> the stain </anteced> was in,its,its,the body's,it,it,it
So I really do not know how large the stain was in its dimensions . but it is pretty clear that there 's a lot of blood there great deal of blood . It makes you think that something criminal occured . But again getting back to how you solve the crime you got to go to the crime scene . and I think there are multiple scenes here . <anteced> Every place there 's blood </anteced>,it,the patterns,it,that,this kind of blood,that
But the most important place is the cabin because that 's presumably where the injury took place . Now there was some rumor about some arguments going <anteced> casino </anteced> the night before . Uh and it could very well be that he was arguing with these individuals . so uh that could be the tie the connection . and I think good policework would connect the individuals in question with,the casino,the names of the victims <anaphor>the SGT <anaphor><|endoftext|><|endoftext|,the hotel room,them,the restaurant,these individuals
Now there was some rumor about some arguments going casino the night before . Uh and it could very well be that he was arguing with these individuals . so uh that could be the tie the connection . and I think good policework would connect the individuals in question with the casino with Mister Smith . and that might help us understand what happened . this is um <anteced> a little bit more sound </anteced> .,This,This,That,It,This,It
Well there absolutely was someone else in that room . And what 's interesting is there was a witness who uh had informed ship 's authorities that <anteced> she </anteced> had heard a scream uh early that morning . And what 's really interesting is uh we do n't know if,she,she,she,she,she,she
Well there absolutely was someone else in that room . And what 's interesting is there was a witness who uh had informed ship 's authorities that <anteced> she </anteced> had heard a scream uh early that morning .
